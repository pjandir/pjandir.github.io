title: My first post!
---

Welcome to my blog! This is my first attempt at a blog. I am still playing around with the style/theme of this site but posts with actual substance will 
start to be put up. Expect to see data analysis and visualization posts catering to my tastes (and maybe yours).

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
