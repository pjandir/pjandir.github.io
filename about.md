Hi, this is my personal site and blog. It is a place for some of my projects, interests (like sports or food), 
and whatever else strikes my fancy. These posts will often feature data and insights thereof.   

My background is in physics which entranced me in my junior year of high school. In fact, I grew so
attached I continued studying it in both undergraduate and graduate school, for a full decade. I am
transitioning from academia to industry where I wish to keep tackling difficult problems and solving them
with various tools, techniques and technologies.  

Born and raised in the Bay Area, I prefer blue skies and a warm sun. I love listening to music, road biking, 
and beard-making. I enjoy getting lost in elaborate and detailed sci-fi/fantasy worlds like those found in 
Star Wars, Warcraft, Stargate, and various comics. Spending time with loved ones is my best therapy.
